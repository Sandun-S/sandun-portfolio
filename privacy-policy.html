                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Information You Provide Directly:</strong> When you use our contact form, we collect the information you submit, such as your name, email address, subject, and message content.

                    <li><strong>Usage Data (Potentially via Analytics):</strong> Like many websites, we may use analytics services (such as Google Analytics) to collect information about how you interact with our site. This may include your IP address, browser type, operating system, pages visited, time spent on pages, and referring URLs. This data helps us understand how visitors use our site and improve its functionality. Google Analytics has its own privacy policy <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Server Logs:</strong> Our hosting provider (Firebase Hosting) automatically collects standard server log information, including IP addresses, browser types, access times, and pages viewed. Firebase Hosting's privacy information can be found within the Google Cloud Platform terms.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
                <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>

                    <li>To prevent fraudulent activity and ensure the security of our website.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How Information is Shared</h2>
                <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We share information with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as Formspree (for contact form processing) and potentially Google Analytics (for website analytics). These providers have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Data Security</h2>
                <p>We take reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free.</p>
